                        <p>To change your major, you need to complete a Major Declaration Form, which can be obtained from the Registrar's Office or downloaded from the student portal. You'll need to meet with an advisor from your intended major department to discuss requirements and get their signature. Then submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office. It's recommended to make this change by the end of your sophomore year to ensure you can complete all requirements on time.</p>

                        <p>The standard course load is 15-18 credits per semester. However, students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher may petition to take up to 21 credits. This requires approval from your academic advisor and the Dean of Students. Additional tuition may apply for credits beyond 18. It's important to consider your other commitments before taking on an increased course load.</p>

                        <p>Student ID cards are issued by the Campus Card Office located in the Student Center. You'll need to bring a government-issued photo ID (driver's license or passport) and your student number. There is typically no charge for your first ID card. Replacement cards cost $25. Your student ID gives you access to campus buildings, library resources, meal plans, and student discounts at local businesses.</p>

If you have financial aid, it will be applied to your account approximately one week before classes begin. Any remaining balance after financial aid is applied is due by the tuition deadline. Payment plans are available through the Bursar's Office.</p>

                        <p>You can withdraw from a course through the student portal during the first 10 weeks of the semester. After that point, you need special permission from the Dean of Students. Withdrawing from a course will result in a "W" on your transcript, which does not affect your GPA. However, it may impact financial aid eligibility if it drops you below full-time status. Always consult with your academic advisor before withdrawing from a course.</p>

If unresolved, you may submit a formal appeal to the department chair, followed by the college dean if necessary. The final level of appeal is the Academic Appeals Committee. Appeals must be submitted within 30 days of the decision being appealed, and you should provide documentation to support your case.</p>
